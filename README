Typo Sliding Posts
==================

This plugin is – obviously – a carousel for Typo, the famous Ruby on Rails blogging system avaliable at http://typosphere.org 

Typo carousel displays featured posts at the topcontent on your blog homepage grabbing pictures from the post.

Install Typo Sliding Posts
==========================

To use Typo Sliding Posts, you'll need to download and install Hpricot. Hpricot is a cool HTML parsing library. Install the gem if you don't have it yet.

Installing Typo Sliding Posts is pretty easy :

./script/plugins install git://github.com/fdv/typo-sliding-posts.git

Then, edit your template, and add this to your articles index view (should be views/articles/index.html.erb) and add the following:

<%= render_sliding_posts(@articles) %>

You're done!

Now, everytime you want to display some featured content on your blog, just add a picture into your post, using the 'carousel' class:

<img src='/some/path.jpg' class='carousel' alt='my cool picture' />

Typo Sliding Posts will take care of everything else.
